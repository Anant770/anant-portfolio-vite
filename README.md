# Anant Chauhan's Portfolio
Hi guys, welcome to my portfolio repo! This project shows my work and includes both Node.js backend and Vite-React frontend.
# Project structure
This project has a similar folder structure but has a serve folder where the backend is and an asset folder where all the images are there.

# Getting Started
### Setup#### 
Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anant770/anant-portfolio-vite.git 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
