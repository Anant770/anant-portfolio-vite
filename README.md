# Anant Chauhan's Portfolio
Hi guys, welcome to my portfolio repo! This project shows my work and includes both Node.js backend and Vite-React frontend.
# Project structure
This project has a similar folder structure but has a serve folder where the backend is and an asset folder where all the images are there.

# Getting Started
### Setup
Clone the Repository:
 ```sh
 git clone https://github.com/Anant770/anant-portfolio-vite.git 
 ```
Navigate to the server folder:
  ```sh
   cd server
  ```
Install the dependencies:
  ```sh
   npm i
  ```
Start the backend:
  ```sh
   npm run dev
  ```
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:8888.

Navigate to the main directory:
  ```sh
   cd anant-portfolio-vite
  ```
Install the dependencies:
  ```sh
   npm i
  ```
Start the project:
  ```sh
   npm run dev
  ```
The frontend application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
You can view the portfolio by opening your browser and navigating to the frontend application URL. The front end communicates with the backend to fetch and display data.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the server folder of your project and add the following variables:

```plaintext
DBUSER=
DBPWD=
DBHOST=
```
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
